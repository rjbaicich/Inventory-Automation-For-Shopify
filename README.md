# Shopify CSV Converter

## Overview

Welcome to the Shopify CSV Converter! This Python script is designed to simplify and automate inventory management for Shopify store owners. By converting a CSV file containing product information into Shopify's required CSV format for product imports, the script streamlines the process of updating and managing your product inventory on the Shopify platform.

## Features

Seamless Integration: Effortlessly integrates into the Shopify platform, simplifying the process of importing product data.
Tailored Mapping Options: Customize column mappings to align with the specific structure of your input CSV file, offering a personalized and adaptable solution.
Modular and Adaptable Design: Built with a modular and flexible architecture, facilitating future integration with other e-commerce platforms for enhanced versatility.
Intuitive User Interface: Strives to deliver a user-friendly interface, streamlining inventory tracking and order fulfillment processes for an efficient user experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install required dependencies using `pip install pandas`.

2. **Usage:**
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Replace the sample input CSV file path with your own file path in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section.

```python
# Specify the path to your input CSV file
input_csv_path = "path/to/your/input_file.csv"

# Convert and save to Shopify format
convert_to_shopify_format(input_csv_path)

Customization:
Customize the column mappings in the mapping dictionary to match your input CSV file columns.

CSV Mapping
In the mapping dictionary, map your CSV columns to their corresponding Shopify columns. This step ensures that the script correctly interprets and formats your data.

mapping = {
    'Handle': 'Product Title',
    'Title': 'Product Title',
    # ... (add more mappings as needed)
}

Output
The script generates a new CSV file named Inventory_update.csv with the Shopify-formatted product information. This file can be directly uploaded to Shopify.
