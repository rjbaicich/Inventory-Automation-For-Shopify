# Shopify CSV Converter

## Overview

Welcome to the Shopify CSV Converter! This Python script is designed to simplify and automate inventory management for Shopify store owners. By converting a CSV file containing product information into Shopify's required CSV format for product imports, the script streamlines the process of updating and managing your product inventory on the Shopify platform.

## Features

- **Effortless Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Shopify's platform, allowing for easy product data import.
- **Customizable Mapping:** Customize column mappings to match your specific input CSV file structure.
- **Flexible Architecture:** Designed with a modular and flexible architecture for future integration with other e-commerce platforms.
- **User-Friendly:** Aims to provide a user-friendly interface for efficient inventory tracking and order fulfillment processes.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install required dependencies using `pip install pandas`.

2. **Usage:**
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Replace the sample input CSV file path with your own file path in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section.

```python
# Specify the path to your input CSV file
input_csv_path = "path/to/your/input_file.csv"

# Convert and save to Shopify format
convert_to_shopify_format(input_csv_path)

Customization:
Customize the column mappings in the mapping dictionary to match your input CSV file columns.

CSV Mapping
In the mapping dictionary, map your CSV columns to their corresponding Shopify columns. This step ensures that the script correctly interprets and formats your data.

mapping = {
    'Handle': 'Product Title',
    'Title': 'Product Title',
    # ... (add more mappings as needed)
}

Output
The script generates a new CSV file named Inventory_update.csv with the Shopify-formatted product information. This file can be directly uploaded to Shopify.
