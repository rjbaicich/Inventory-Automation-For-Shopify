                          ****WORK IN PROGRESS****

Currently, my Python program is in the development stage, with the primary objective of streamlining and automating inventory management for Shopify. The program represents an exciting step towards improving the efficiency and accuracy of inventory tracking and order fulfillment processes. At this stage, the focus is on building a robust foundation that can seamlessly integrate with Shopify's platform, allowing businesses to effortlessly monitor product stocks, receive real-time notifications for low inventory, and automate order updates. By harnessing the power of Python, I am working diligently to create a user-friendly interface and incorporate functionalities that can cater to the unique needs of Shopify store owners.

However, my vision extends beyond Shopify. While currently tailored for this platform, I aim to design a flexible and versatile inventory management system that can adapt to other e-commerce platforms as well. This forward-looking approach involves developing a modular architecture that will pave the way for easy integration with various e-commerce systems in the future. My ultimate goal is to provide businesses with a unified solution for managing their inventory across multiple platforms, thereby saving time, reducing manual errors, and enhancing overall operational efficiency. As the program evolves and gains sophistication, it is poised to become a valuable asset for online retailers seeking a comprehensive inventory management solution.

# Shopify CSV Converter

## Overview

This Python script converts a CSV file containing product information into Shopify's required CSV format for product imports. It uses the pandas library to read and manipulate the data.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. Modify the input CSV file path and column mappings in the script.
4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python shopify_converter.py
    ```

5. The converted CSV file, `output_shopify.csv`, will be generated.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library
